# Smart-T
 A system for novel fully automated anticipatory eye-tracking paradigms

## Abstract
 Anticipatory eye-movements (AEMs) are a natural and implicit measure of cognitive processing, and have been successfully used to document important cognitive capacities like learning, categorization and generalization, especially in infancy (McMurray& Aslin, 2004).  Here, we describe an improved AEM paradigm to automatically assess on-line learning on a trial-by-trial basis, by analyzing eye-gaze data in each inter-trial interval of a training phase. Different measures of learning can be evaluated simultaneously. We describe the implementation of a system for designing and running a variety of such AEM paradigms. Additionally, this system is capable of a wider variety of gaze-contingent paradigms, as well as implementations of standard non-contingent paradigms.  Our system, Smart-T (System forMonitoring Anticipations in Real Time with the Tobii), is a set of Matlab scripts with a graphical front-end, written using the Psychtoolbox. The system gathers eye gaze data using the commercially available Tobii eye trackers via a Matlab module,Talk2Tobii. We report a pilot study showing that Smart-T can detect 6-month-old infantsâ€™ learning of simple predictive patterns involving the disappearance and re-appearance of multimodal stimuli.
